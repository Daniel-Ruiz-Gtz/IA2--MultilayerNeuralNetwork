# Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network Visualization

This Python code is a simple visualization tool for a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. It uses Matplotlib to plot the neural network's decision boundaries and allows the user to interactively input data points with left-clicks and right-clicks to label them. The neural network's training process uses a gradient descent algorithm to update its weights and find decision boundaries for the given data points.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

To run the code, execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python filename.py
```

- Left-click on the plot to label the data point as "Class 1."
- Right-click on the plot to label the data point as "Class 0."
- Click the "Iniciar" button to start the training process of the MLP neural network.
- During the training process, the code will display the neural network's decision boundaries after certain iterations to visualize the learning progress.

Please note that this code is intended for educational purposes and might not be suitable for complex real-world problems. It serves as a simple demonstration of how a multilayer perceptron neural network can be visualized and trained using basic gradient descent.
